"""Environment health check for the Amharic dubbing pipeline.

Reports the runtime prerequisites needed on the GPU worker (a RunPod A40 pod
built from the official RunPod PyTorch image) or on a local machine:

* Python version
* PyTorch version (only if it is installed)
* whether CUDA is available
* GPU name and available VRAM (only if CUDA is available)
* FFmpeg availability

With ``--full`` it also runs the pre-flight checks that must pass before a paid
GPU session is started:

* the credentials the pipeline needs, including a warning when a value is still
  the placeholder copied from ``.env.example``
* every third-party module the stages import at run time
* every stage module of this project, so a broken import in the checkout is caught
  here rather than halfway through a paid run

The script never calls an external API and never downloads a model, so it is safe
to run before anything is configured. Exit code is ``0`` when no blocking problem
is found and ``1`` otherwise.
