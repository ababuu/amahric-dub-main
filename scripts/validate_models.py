"""Initialise every model the pipeline needs, one at a time, and report.

The stages load their models lazily, so a missing checkpoint, a rejected Hugging
Face token or an incompatible package only shows up partway through a run - after
other models have already been downloaded. This script loads each model by itself,
prints what happened, and releases it before moving on, so a failure names exactly
one component.

Which translation and synthesis models are checked follows the configuration:

* ``TRANSLATION_BACKEND`` selects a local ``nllb`` checkpoint, or ``openai`` for a
  served instruction-following model (``TRANSLATION_PROVIDER`` picks the vendor).
* ``TTS_ENGINE`` selects ``omnivoice`` (the default), or ``mms``.

Only the selected ones are loaded. Checking the other pair would download many
gigabytes a run never touches and, worse, would leave the models it *does* use
unchecked, so the pre-flight would pass and the run would still fail. To check the
other configuration, set the environment variables::

    TRANSLATION_BACKEND=openai TTS_ENGINE=mms python scripts/validate_models.py

::

    python scripts/validate_models.py
    python scripts/validate_models.py --only nllb
    python scripts/validate_models.py --only separation,mms

Each step drives the stage's *own* loader (``separation``'s model, ``diarization``'s
pipeline loader, ``transcription``'s model loader, ``translation``'s backend,
``tts``'s engines), so what is validated here is the same code path a real run
takes. The translation and synthesis steps go one step further than loading and run
one probe line through the model, because a checkpoint that loads can still reject
every input. ``scripts/test_gpu.py`` is the end-to-end run.

Models are dropped and CUDA's cache is emptied between steps, so the whole
validation fits on a single 48 GB card even though every model is loaded.
