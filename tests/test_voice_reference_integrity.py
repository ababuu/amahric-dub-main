"""A voice reference must be one voice, and its transcript must describe it.

Both rules come from a real cloning failure. The reference that produced it was the
10.0s window 20.0-30.0s of the dialogue stem, chosen from a stride grid. Two things
were wrong with it, and neither was visible in the measurements the selection used:

* the diarization reported simultaneous speech at 26.27-26.85s and 27.82-28.57s, both
  inside the window, so the recording held two people - yet the profile stated
  "0.0s overlapped by other speakers", because the per-line overlap check compares
  *exclusive* turns and those can never overlap;
* the window began 2.6s before the first line it recorded and ended 1.9s after the
  last, so about 4.5s of the prompt audio had no transcript at all.

OmniVoice, like the other cloning engines, is handed the reference transcript and the
line to speak as one text stream, so a transcript that covers only part of its own
audio is an invitation to speak the difference.
