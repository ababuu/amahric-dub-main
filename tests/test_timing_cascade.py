"""A line that runs long must move the next one, never speak over it.

The GPU run of the test film produced 29 overlaps, including two passages where the
same character talked over themselves for 2.72s and 2.26s. Every one of them was a
line whose Amharic needed more time than the film had left it, placed on top of the
next line's original start. Two voices at once is the one outcome a dub cannot have,
so the overrun is paid for in position instead of in intelligibility.
