"""The original dialogue must not be left in the bed that gets re-mixed.

The music and effects stems are summed back in untouched, so the only way the source
language can reach a finished dub is the separator leaving it there. On the GPU run
under investigation this was checked line by line against the real stems: 0 of 42
dialogue windows carried the original speech above -56 dBFS. The measurement is now
part of every run, because the alternative is hearing about it from a viewer.
