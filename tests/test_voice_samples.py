"""Tests for native-speaker voice samples.

The reason this mechanism exists is a specific audible defect: a reference cut from the
film is the original actor speaking English, and the cloning engine conditions on its
reference, so the Amharic arrives in that performance's phonetics. These tests cover the
parts that decide whether a native recording actually reaches the engine - the
assignment, the trimming, the format and the transcript - rather than the audio itself,
which only a listen can judge.
