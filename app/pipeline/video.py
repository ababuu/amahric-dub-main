"""Video input/output handling with FFmpeg.

Two ends of the pipeline, of which the first is implemented:

* **Demux/extract** - :func:`extract_audio` pulls the audio track out of the
  source video in the canonical pipeline format (48 kHz stereo PCM WAV), which is
  the only format :func:`app.pipeline.separation.separate_stems` accepts.
* **Mux/export** - :func:`mux_dub` puts the final mixed Amharic audio back into
  the video. The original video stream is copied, never re-encoded, and the
  original audio streams are **replaced**: carrying them over would keep the
  English dialogue in the deliverable, which is the whole point of the dub.

Why the extraction lives here rather than in the runner
------------------------------------------------------
The extraction was previously inlined in ``scripts/test_gpu.py``. It belongs to
this stage so the runner and the orchestrator share one implementation, one
sample rate and one set of errors instead of each spelling them out again.

Stream handling is explicit
---------------------------
Both ends inspect the actual streams with ``ffprobe`` rather than trusting file
names: an earlier attempt muxed a 48 kHz track into a video whose audio was
reported around 44.1 kHz and produced AAC decode errors, because matching
filenames were taken to mean matching formats. Extraction verifies what it wrote
and muxing verifies what it produced.

#: through to the stream.
