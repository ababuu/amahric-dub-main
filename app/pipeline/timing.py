"""Timing alignment for dubbed dialogue.

Each synthesized clip is fitted to the window of the line it replaces:

* the **speech** of the line is time-stretched, pitch-preserving, to the length of
  the original line, so the dub lands on the same beats as the performance;
* the **rendered pauses** are left alone - they are deliberate silence, not slack
  to be absorbed - so a line's leading pause still precedes the line;
* a line that would need more than the configured tempo band is **reported** as
  not fitting rather than mangled to fit, and the run records by how much;
* a line that is still too long **moves the next line later** instead of being
  spoken over it, so two voices are never heard at once unless the source put
  them there.

The result of this stage is one aligned WAV per line at the pipeline sample rate,
plus where to place it in the timeline, which is exactly what
:mod:`app.pipeline.mixing` consumes.

Deliberate non-goals
--------------------
* **No resampling for change of speed.** Speed is changed with FFmpeg's
  ``atempo``, which preserves pitch; resampling a clip to change its length would
  shift every voice up or down, which is never wanted.
* **No fitting across the tempo band.** Nothing here silently rewrites what the
  dialogue model asked for: a clamped stretch is recorded on the clip.
* **No padding to fill a window.** A short line keeps its natural delivery and is
  placed at its original start; the gap that follows is silence, not stretched
  speech.
* **No touching of the clip files.** The clips remain the TTS stage's artifacts;
  the aligned audio is written beside them.

    ----------

        Directory to keep the aligned lines in. Defaults to

        One entry per input clip, in the same order. An empty input returns an
        empty list without touching FFmpeg. A line that could not fit its time is

    ------

        The tempo band is not usable.
    InvalidClipError
        An entry is not a :class:`~app.pipeline.tts.TtsClip`.
    MissingInputError
        A clip's audio file does not exist.

    A line whose Amharic needs more time than the film left it cannot be fitted without
    either rushing it past intelligibility or cutting a word off the end. Both were
    tried; both were audible. So the overrun is paid for in position instead: the next
    line waits until this one has finished, except for the configured short handover
    allowance between different speakers. Originally simultaneous lines are subject to
    the same cap as any other handover.

    ``overlap`` is the concession that keeps the picture: up to this many seconds of the
    previous line may still be sounding when the next one starts, which is what a
    conversation already sounds like, before the next line is moved at all. A third of a
    second of hand-over is heard as a natural interruption; three seconds of it is two
    people talking at once, which is the thing a dub must never do.

    The allowance is for a change of speaker. The same character never hands over to
    themselves - their turns do not overlap in the source, and the same voice laid over
    itself is not heard as an interruption but as a stutter, because the ear has nothing
    to separate the two copies with. So one speaker's speech is never left sounding under
    their own next line.

    Everything here is measured between *speech* boundaries rather than file boundaries.
    A clip carries its rendered pauses with it, and silence over silence is inaudible, so
