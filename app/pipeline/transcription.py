"""Speech transcription with **faster-whisper** ``large-v3``.

This module is the only place in the pipeline that talks to ``faster_whisper``.
It consumes the dialogue stem written by :mod:`app.pipeline.separation` together
with the speaker turns produced by :mod:`app.pipeline.diarization`, and returns
one :class:`TranscriptSegment` per transcribed utterance::

    speech.wav + [SpeakerSegment, ...] -> transcribe() -> [TranscriptSegment, ...]

Each diarized region is transcribed on its own, so every line is attributed to
the speaker who actually said it instead of being guessed afterwards from a
whole-movie transcript.

Those segments are pause-delimited, not sentence-delimited, so
:func:`assemble_sentences` turns them into the :class:`DialogueSentence` units the
rest of the pipeline adapts and speaks. A sentence keeps every timestamp of its
parts, and the parts stay available for the performance metadata that genuinely
changes inside one thought.

Timing model
------------
faster-whisper is handed the samples of a single diarized region, so the
timestamps it reports are relative to the *start of that region*. They are
translated back onto the movie timeline with::

    absolute = region.start + whisper_local

and then clamped to ``[region.start, region.end]`` so a transcript segment can
never claim speech outside the diarized turn it came from. The diarization
timestamps themselves are never replaced by Whisper's, only used as the offset.

Contract with the ``faster_whisper`` package (checked against 1.2.1)
------------------------------------------------------------------
* ``WhisperModel(model, device=..., device_index=..., compute_type=...,
  download_root=...)`` loads the model.
* ``model.transcribe(audio, language=..., task=..., word_timestamps=...)``
  accepts a 16 kHz mono float32 NumPy array and returns
  ``(Iterable[Segment], TranscriptionInfo)``; the iterator is lazy, so inference
  only really runs when it is consumed.
* ``Segment`` exposes ``start``, ``end`` and ``text`` in seconds, relative to the
  audio that was passed in.
* ``decode_audio(path, sampling_rate=16000)`` decodes a file to that NumPy array.
* ``model.detect_language(audio)`` returns ``(language, probability, all_probs)``
  and only inspects the beginning of the audio, so it is cheap.

Deliberate non-goals
--------------------
* **No CUDA -> CPU fallback.** The device comes from the project settings, and an
  explicit ``cuda`` request that is unavailable must fail loudly. ``auto`` is
  never used, because that is exactly the silent fallback we must avoid.
* **No translation.** ``task`` is always ``"transcribe"``; adaptation into
  Amharic belongs to :mod:`app.pipeline.translation`.
* **No model downloads at import time** (and none in the test suite).
* **No faster-whisper objects in the public API.** Callers only ever see
  :class:`TranscriptSegment`.
