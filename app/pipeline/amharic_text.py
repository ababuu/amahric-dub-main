"""Amharic text primitives: syllables, homogenisation, comparison.

A leaf module with no imports from the rest of the pipeline, so both
:mod:`app.pipeline.qc` (measuring a run) and
:mod:`app.pipeline.dialogue_context` (budgeting a line) can use it without the two
ending up in an import cycle.

Why syllables, and not phonemes
-------------------------------
Amharic is written in the Ethiopic (Fidel) syllabary, where **one character is one
syllable**. That makes a syllable count available from the text alone - no
grapheme-to-phoneme model, no pronunciation lexicon, no forced aligner. That
matters because there is no standard Amharic G2P and no neural one, so a
phoneme-based design would have nothing to stand on; a syllable-based one works
today. It is the unit the timing budget and the delivery-rate measurement are both
expressed in.

Homophone families
------------------
The script carries several letters that are pronounced identically in modern
Amharic (ሀ/ሐ/ኀ, ሰ/ሠ, አ/ዐ, ጸ/ፀ). A difference between two of them is an orthographic
choice, not a pronunciation error, so folding them before a comparison stops a
measurement from punishing spelling. Folding is applied at *comparison* time only:
the budget counts what is written, because that is what is synthesized.
