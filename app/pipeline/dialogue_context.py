"""Long-form dialogue context: scenes, character voices, and a duration budget.

The adaptation stage sees a film as a list of lines. Three things it needs are not
in that list, and they are the three things a film has that a short clip does not:

* **Scene structure.** A batch of ten consecutive lines can straddle a cut, so the
  model is told where the scene boundaries are and who is in the scene, rather than
  inferring a new location from the dialogue alone.
* **Characters.** A film runs 90-180 minutes, and consistency has to survive all of
  it: names, address forms, honorifics, register, relationships. That cannot be an
  LLM's recall over a ten-line window, so it is *state* - a persistent
  :class:`CharacterBible` that is handed to every request.
* **A time budget.** Amharic words are longer than English ones, so a faithful
  translation of an English line routinely needs more time than the original took.
  The budget is expressed in **syllables**, because one Fidel character is one
  syllable and Amharic therefore has a syllable count with no G2P model - the same
  reason :mod:`app.pipeline.qc` measures rate in syllables.

Why a budget rather than more stretching
---------------------------------------
The one large human study of professional dubbing found the audience complaint is
an unnatural *speaking rate* - "too slow, too fast, or too uneven" - and that
*shorter* translation output enables better synchronisation. So the line is asked
to fit before it is synthesized, and only a small final trim is left to
:mod:`app.pipeline.timing`. Time-stretching is what you do when the budget was
ignored, not the mechanism that makes a line fit.

Deliberate non-goals
--------------------
* **No models.** Everything here is arithmetic over timings and text.
* **No invention.** A character that is not in the bible is not guessed at; a
  scene is derived from the line timings, not from a model's idea of a scene.
* **No failing on a missing bible.** A run without one still works; it just has no
  consistency state to offer, which the prompt says rather than papers over.
