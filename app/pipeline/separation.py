    """Measure how much of the **original audio** survives in the dubbed dialogue.

    :func:`measure_bed_bleed` answers "did separation leave the original in the music
    and effects". It cannot answer "is the original audible in the finished dub",
    because the dubbed dialogue track is not part of what it inspects - and the
    finished dub is what a listener hears. This measures the other half.

    ``dialogue`` is the mix's own dialogue stem, before the bed is added, so anything
    the original shares with it came from the original rather than from the music.
    The two are compared both in level and in waveform, over a small lag search,
    because a copy is only a copy if it is *the same audio*: an Amharic line spoken by
    a cloned voice of the same character resembles the original not at all.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original:
        The film's own soundtrack - the extracted track, not a stem.
    dialogue:
        The dubbed dialogue stem written by :mod:`app.pipeline.mixing`.
    windows:
        ``(start, end)`` of every line the dub contains - the moments a line should be
        the *only* thing in the dialogue stem.
    threshold_db, correlation_threshold:
        How close, and how alike, the two have to be before the original is judged
        audible. Both are required, so loud unrelated material is not a leak.

    Returns
    -------
    BleedReport
        With ``subject`` set to ``"the dubbed dialogue"``.
